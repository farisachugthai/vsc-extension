# VSCode Hello World

Wow holy shit `yo` is effective.

I was really fucking confused and went on a weird debugging goose hunt for
a minute.

Ensure that:

A) yo is installed globally not just in the repository you're in

B) Windows users need to have wmic on the `$PATH` and that exe is in
   C:\Windows\System32\wbem
   So ensure it's been added!
